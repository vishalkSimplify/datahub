# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```console
yarn install
```

## Local Development

```sh
# This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window.
../gradlew yarnStart

# Every time a markdown file is changed, update the site:
# If a more complex docs site change is made, you'll need to restart the server.
../gradlew fastReload
```

## Build

```console
../gradlew yarnBuild
```

This command generates static content into the `dist` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service. You can preview the built static site using `../gradlew serve`, although we're recommend using the local development instructions locally.

## Generating GraphQL API Docs

To regenerate GraphQL API docs, simply rebuild the docs-website directory. 

```console
./gradlew docs-website:build
```

## Managing Content

Please use the following steps when adding/managing content for the docs site.

### Leverage Documentation Templates

* [Feature Guide Template](./docs/_feature-guide-template.md)
* [Metadata Ingestion Source Template](./metadata-ingestion/source-docs-template.md)

### Self-Hosted vs. Managed DataHub

The docs site includes resources for both self-hosted (aka open-source) DataHub and Managed DataHub alike.

* All Feature Guides should include the `FeatureAvailability` component within the markdown file itself
* Features only available via Managed DataHub should have the `saasOnly` class if they are included in `sidebar.js` to display the small "cloud" icon:

```
{
  type: "doc",
  id: "path/to/document",
  className: "saasOnly",
},
```

### Sidebar Display Options

`generateDocsDir.ts` has a bunch of logic to auto-generate the docs site Sidebar; here are a few ways to manage how documents are displayed.

1. Leverage the document's H1 value

By default, the Sidebar will display the H1 value of the Markdown file, not the file name itself.

**NOTE:** `generateDocsDir.ts` will strip leading values of `DataHub ` and `About DataHub ` to minimize repetitive values of DataHub in the sidebar

2. Hard-code the section title in `generateDocsDir.ts`

Map the file to a hard-coded value in `const hardcoded_titles`

3. Assign a `title` separate from the H1 value

You can add the following details at the top of the markdown file:

```
---
title: [value to display in the sidebar]
---
```

*This will be ignored your H1 value begins with `DataHub ` or `About DataHub `*

**NOTE:** Assigning a value for `label:` in `sidebar.js` is not reliable, e.g.

```
  { // Don't do this
    label: "Usage Guide",
    type: "doc",
    id: "path/to/document",
  },
```

### Determine the Appropriate Sidebar Section

When adding a new document to the site, determine the appropriate sidebar section:

**What is DataHub?**

By the end of this section, readers should understand the core use cases that DataHub addresses, target end-users, high-level architecture, & hosting options.

**Get Started**

The goal of this section is to provide the bare-minimum steps required to:
  - Get DataHub Running
  - Optionally configure SSO
  - Add/invite Users
  - Create Polices & assign roles
  - Ingest at least one source (i.e., data warehouse)
  - Understand high-level options for enriching metadata

**Ingest Metadata**

This section aims to provide a deeper understanding of how ingestion works. Readers should be able to find details for ingesting from all systems, apply transformers, understand sinks, and understand key concepts of the Ingestion Framework (Sources, Sinks, Transformers, and Recipes).

**Enrich Metadata**

The purpose of this section is to provide direction on how to enrich metadata when shift-left isnâ€™t an option.

**Act on Metadata**

This section provides concrete examples of acting on metadata changes in real-time and enabling Active Metadata workflows/practices. 

**Deploy DataHub**

The purpose of this section is to provide the minimum steps required to deploy DataHub to the vendor of your choosing.

**Developer Guides**

The purpose of this section is to provide developers & technical users with concrete tutorials on how to work with the DataHub CLI & APIs.

**Feature Guides**

This section aims to provide plain-language feature overviews for both technical and non-technical readers alike.
