# Enriching Metadata in DataHub

Metadata Enrichment is a powerful way to annotate entities within DataHub, supercharging data discoverability and ensuring end-users have quick access to critical context for a given entity, such as:

* **Ownership**: who is responsible/accountable?
* **Description**: what is the intended use case? What known caveats/edge cases exist?
* **Glossary Terms**: how is it relevant to core business metrics?
* **Domain**: how is it associated with organizational domains?

This section contains detailed usage guides to help you begin enriching your data entities within DataHub.
